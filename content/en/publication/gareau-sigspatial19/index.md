abstract: 'In the last few years, several studies have considered different
variants of the Electric Vehicle Journey Planning (EVJP) problem that consists
in finding the shortest path (according to time) between two given points,
passing by several charging stations and respecting the range of the vehicle.
The total time taken by the vehicle is the sum of the driving time, the charging
time and the waiting time. Unfortunately, the consideration of the waiting time
has been neglected by previous studies. This study aims to fill this gap by
introducing: (1) a graph relabeling technique using a probabilistic model of
charging station occupancy generated using real EV stations data; (2) an
alternative paths generation technique which accounts for worse than expected
waiting time at various charging stations. Our empirical results indicate that
the a priori consideration of charging station occupancy by graph relabeling
can reduce the waiting time by more than 75%, while having a negligible impact
on the driving time, and that the generation of alternative paths helps reduce
the waiting (and total) time even more. For our public station network dataset
and the current station occupancy (for now quite low), the mean total journey
time (computed over 1000 requests) decreased by 17.3 minutes when our new
technique was used.'
