summary: ''
abstract: 'Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are often used in Artificial
Intelligence to solve probabilistic sequential decision-making problems. In the
last decades, many probabilistic planning algorithms have been developed to
solve MDPs. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks makes it difficult to
compare the performance of these algorithms in different contexts. In this
paper, we identify important topological properties of MDPs that can make a
significant impact on the relative performance of probabilistic planning
algorithms. We also propose a new approach to generate synthetic MDP domains
having different topological properties. This approach relies on the connection
between MDPs and graphs and allows every graph generation technique to be used
to generate synthetic MDP domains.'
