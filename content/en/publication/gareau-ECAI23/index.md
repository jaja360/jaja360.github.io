  Automated planning research often focuses on developing new algorithms to
  improve the computational performance of planners, but effective
  implementation can also play a significant role. Hardware features such as
  memory hierarchy can yield substantial running time improvements when
  optimized. In this paper, we propose two state-reordering techniques for the
  Topological Value Iteration (TVI) algorithm. Our first technique organizes
  states in memory so that those belonging to the same Strongly Connected
  Component (SCC) are contiguous, while our second technique optimizes state
  value propagation by reordering states within each SCC. We analyze existing
  planning algorithms with respect to their cache efficiency and describe domain
  characteristics which can provide an advantage to each of them. Empirical
  results show that, in many instances, our new algorithms, called eTVI and
  eiTVI, run several times faster than traditional VI, TVI, LRTDP and ILAO*
  techniques.
