abstract: |
  Over the past few years, several studies have considered the problem of
  Electric Vehicle Path Planning with intermediate recharge (EVPP-R) that
  consists of finding the shortest path between two given points by traveling
  through one or many charging stations, without exceeding the vehicle’s range.
  Unfortunately, the exact solution to this problem has a high computational
  cost. Therefore, speedup techniques are generally necessary (e.g., contraction
  hierarchies). In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new fast and intuitive
  graph clustering technique, which is applied on a real map with charging
  station data. We show that by grouping nearby stations, we can reduce the
  number of stations considered by a factor of 13 and increase the speed of
  computation by a factor of 35, while having a very limited trade-off increase,
  of less than 1%, on the average journey duration time.
