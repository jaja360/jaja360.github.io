abstract: |
  The Cooperative Electric Vehicles Planning Problem (CEVPP) has recently been
  proposed as a multi-agent variant of the Electric Vehicle Path-Planning
  Problem (EVPP). It consists in finding a set of paths for a fleet of electric
  vehicles that minimizes the global plan execution time, including the time
  spent waiting at the charging stations. In the proposed formulation, new
  Electric Vehicles (EVs) can join the fleet at any time, and a centralized
  planner recomputes the optimal plan every now and then to take them into
  account. However, the newly computed plans of EVs that were already on the
  road can change drastically, compared to their previous plans. In this paper,
  we propose an extension of CEVPP that considers the plan stability in the
  objective function as a way to reduce cognitive load on the human drivers. The
  results of our experiments, conducted with real road networks and charging
  stations, indicate that our approach can significantly reduce the variability
  of the optimal plans, while keeping low the global plan execution time.
