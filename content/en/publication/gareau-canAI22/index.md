summary: ''
abstract: 'Research in automated planning typically focuses on the development
of new or improved algorithms. Yet, an equally important but often overlooked
topic is that of how to actually implement these algorithms efficiently. In this
study, we are making an attempt to close this gap in the context of optimal
Markov Decision Process (MDP) planning.  Precisely, we present a novel
cache-efficient memory representation of MDPs, which we call CSR-MDP, that takes
advantage of low-level hardware features such as memory hierarchy. We evaluate
the speed improvement provided by our memory representation by comparing the
performance of CSR-MDP with the performance obtained by traditional MDP
representation. We show that by using our CSR-MDP memory representation,
existing MDP solvers, including VI, LRTDP and TVI, are able to find an optimal
policy an order of magnitude faster.'
