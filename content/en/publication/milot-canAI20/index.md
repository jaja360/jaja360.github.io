abstract: |
  This paper presents a novel approach for trip reconstruction and transport
  mode detection. While traditional methods use a fixed GPS sampling rate, our
  proposed method uses a dynamic rate to avoid unnecessary sensing and waste of
  energy. We determine a time for each sampling that gives an interesting
  trade-off using a particle filter. Our approach uses as input a map, including
  transit network circuits and schedules, and produces as output the estimated
  road segments and transport modes used. The effectiveness of our approach is
  shown empirically using real map and transit network data. Our technique
  achieves an accuracy of 96.3% for a 15.0% energy consumption reduction
  (compared to the existing technique that has the closest accuracy) and an
  accuracy of 85.6% for a 56.0% energy consumption reduction.
