I am currently a Computer science PhD candidate at Universit√© du Qu√©bec
√† Montr√©al (UQAM). My Master's research focused on planning algorithms for
electric vehicles (EV) to find the optimal path between two points such that
the total journey time (including the travel time, charging time and expected
waiting time at the charging stations) is minimized.
