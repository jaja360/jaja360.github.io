I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at Universit√©
T√âLUQ, where my research focuses on speeding up the conversion of floating-point
numbers into decimal strings. During my doctoral studies, I designed algorithms
and data structures that leverage modern computer architectures to solve large
instances of Markov decision processes (MDPs). In my master‚Äôs research, I
developed routing algorithms for electric vehicles aimed at determining the
optimal path between two points while minimizing total travel time (including
driving, charging, and expected waiting time at charging stations).
