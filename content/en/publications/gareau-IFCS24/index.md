abstract: |
  Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are often used in Artificial Intelligence to
  solve probabilistic sequential decision-making problems. In the last decades,
  many probabilistic planning algorithms have been developed to solve MDPs.
  However, the lack of standardized benchmarks makes it difficult to compare the
  performance of these algorithms in different contexts. In this paper, we
  identify important topological properties of MDPs that can make a significant
  impact on the relative performance of probabilistic planning algorithms. We
  also propose a new approach to generate synthetic MDP domains having different
  topological properties. This approach relies on the connection between MDPs
  and graphs and allows every graph generation technique to be used to generate
  synthetic MDP domains.
