abstract: |
  This paper introduces a new algorithm for solving the discrete grid-based
  coverage path-planning (CPP) problem. This problem consists in finding a path
  that covers a given region completely. Our algorithm is based on an iterative
  deepening depth-first search. We introduce two branch-and-bound improvements
  (Loop detection and Admissible heuristic) to this algorithm. We evaluate the
  performance of our planner using four types of generated grids. The obtained
  results show that the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm solves the problem
  optimally and orders of magnitude faster than traditional optimal CPP
  planners.
