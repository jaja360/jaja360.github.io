bio: |
  I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at Université
  TÉLUQ, where my research focuses on speeding up the conversion of integer and
  floating-point numbers into decimal strings. During my doctoral studies, I
  designed algorithms and data structures that leverage modern computer
  architectures to solve large instances of Markov decision processes (MDPs). In
  my master’s research, I developed routing algorithms for electric vehicles
  aimed at determining the optimal path between two points while minimizing
  travel time (including driving, charging, and expected waiting time at
  charging stations).
